        <h2 style="color:beige">One day, he suddenly encountered a big worm,  
            Blocking his way forward,    
            Introduced him to an unknown and unfriendly world.</h1>

        <h2 style="color:beige">The boy was very sensitive to sound and light,

            So he built secret hiding places where they couldn't get in.</h1>

        <h2 style="color:beige">This boy didn't like looking people in the eye,
            He didn't have malice, it just made him uncomfortable.

        <img src="../images/0 (4).gif">
        <h2 style="color:beige">Sometimes, he would constantly slap his arm.
            (It's because he imagined he could fly.)
            One day, he found out he has something called autism.
            Luckily, his family got he help and love.
            Slowly, he found his voice and learned all the way he can live with it better.</h1>
