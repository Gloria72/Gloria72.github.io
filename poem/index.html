            <p>I wanna write lyrical, but all I got is magical. </p>
            <p>My book needs a poem talkin bout I remember when
                <br>Something more autobiographical</br></p>

            <p>Mi familia wanted to assimilate, nothing radical,
                <br>Each month was a struggle to pay our rent</br>
                <br>With food stamps, so dust collects on the magical.</br>
                
            </p>
            <p>Each month it got a little less civil
                <br>Isolation is a learned defense</br>
                <br>When all you wanna do is write lyrical.</br>
            </p>

            <p>None of us escaped being a criminal
                <br>Of the state, institutionalized when</br>
                <br>They found out all we had was magical.</br></p>

            <p>White room is white room, it’s all statistical—
                <br>Our calendars were divided by Sundays spent</br>
                <br>visiting hours. Cold metal chairs deny the lyrical.</br>
            </p>
            <p>I keep my genes in the sharp light of the celestial.
                <br>My history writes itself in sheets across my veins.</br>
                <br>My parents believed in prayer, I believed in magical</br>
            </p>
            <p>Well, at least I believed in curses, biblical
                <br>Or not, I believed in sharp fists,</br> 
                <br>Beat myself into lyrical.</br>
            </p>
            <p>But we were each born into this, anger so cosmical
                <br>Or so I thought, I wore ten chokers and a chain</br>
                <br>Couldn’t see any significance, anger is magical.</br>
                <br>Fists to scissors to drugs to pills to fists again</br></p>
            <p>Did you know a poem can be both mythical and archeological?
                <br>I ignore the cataphysical, and I anoint my own clavicle.</br>
